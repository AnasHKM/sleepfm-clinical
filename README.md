## üìñ Introduction

Sleep is a fundamental biological process with broad implications for physical and mental health, yet its complex relationship with disease remains poorly understood. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep analysis, captures rich physiological signals but remains underutilized due to challenges in standardization, generalizability, and multimodal signal integration. To address this, we curated over 585,000 hours of PSG data from approximately 65,000 participants across multiple cohorts and developed SleepFM, a multimodal sleep foundation model trained with a novel contrastive learning approach that accommodates any PSG montage. SleepFM produces sleep embeddings that enable accurate prediction of future disease risk. We demonstrate that SleepFM achieves a C-Index and AUROC of at least 0.75 (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.01) for 130 conditions, including death (C-Index: 0.84), heart failure (0.80), chronic kidney disease (0.79), dementia (0.85), stroke (0.78), atrial fibrillation (0.78), and myocardial infarction (0.81). The model generalizes well to the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), a dataset excluded from pretraining, where it achieves strong transfer learning performance. In addition, SleepFM performs competitively on traditional sleep analysis tasks, including sleep staging (mean F1 scores: 0.70‚Äì0.78) and sleep apnea classification (0.69 and 0.87 accuracy for severity and presence, respectively). Further analysis reveals that different sleep stages and physiological signals carry distinct predictive power for specific diseases. This work demonstrates that foundation models can extract clinically meaningful features from raw PSG data, enabling scalable, label-efficient analysis and disease prediction.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Usage

*This is a research code. Here, we provide our pretraining pipeline with a publicly available dataset, as we cannot release our internal pretraining dataset at the moment.*

This codebase will serve as a framework that you can adapt to your dataset for pretraining and testing. Below, we outline the steps to pretrain and adapt the model on a publicly available dataset called [MESA](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mesa). Please keep in mind that this dataset is small and will most likely not yield optimal results.

**Note**: Please make sure to download the dataset with in your local path, with dataset name, `mesa`. Later on, we will need this path. 


## Preprocessing Dataset

PSG files may be stored in different formats. Here, we specifically provide scripts to process .EDF file format.

- **Step 0:** `preprocessing/preprocessing.py`
  - This script converts .EDF file into .hdf5 files with is the format that the model will expect below. 


## Pretraining

Note that we provide with dataset split as json file here: `configs/dataset_split.json`. We also provide with different channel groups within a modality: `configs/channel_groups.json`.

- **Step 1:** `pipeline/pretrain.py`
  - This script has our main pretraining config. Its corresponding config file is inside `configs/config_set_transformer_contrastive.yaml`, where you will set all the parameters and data path. 
- **Step 2:** `pipeline/generate_embeddings.py`
  - After pretraining our model, we want to generate the embeddings for train/valid/test so that we can train a model for downstream classification. We do sleep stage classification here. 

## Evaluation

Note: These evaluation results will not match the ones that we have in our paper as this is a small dataset. This step does not require GPU support. 

You should also have extracted the sleep stage labels, which should look like this:

```csv
Start,Stop,StageName,StageNumber
0.0,5190.0,Wake,0
0.0,5190.0,Wake,0,
0.0,5190.0,Wake,0
```

These labels files are stored inside a folder as such `<path>/mesa/mesa-sleep-0001.csv`. Note that `mesa-sleep-0001` is the filename that should correspond with the original `.EDF` file and `.hdf5` files. 

- **Step 3:** `finetune_sleep_staging.py`
  - This will finetune the pretrained model on sleep stage classification task. Please make sure to check config `configs/config_finetune_sleep_events.yaml`. 

- **Step 4:** `evaluate_sleep_staging.py`
  - This will evaluate the model on test set.
